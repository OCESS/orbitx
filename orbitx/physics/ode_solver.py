    Given the state of a simulation, calculate its instantaneous rate-of-change.

    This function is probably one of the most important ones in OrbitX :)
    Everything from "an object with a velocity will change position" to
    "the habitat reactor heats up when it's being used" is encoded here.

    This function is used by scipy.solve_ivp, which unfortunately requires
    that the y_1d input of this function is a single 1-dimensional array.
    We also have the same requirement of this function's output. This means
    that we have to encode almost the entire state of the OrbitX simulation
    in the y_1d input array, and every single value in that array has to have
    a corresponding output value in the output array. This is a big array!

    This is roughly the ordering of fields in the input array:

    y_1d =
     [X, Y, VX, VY, Heading, Spin, Fuel, Throttle, LandedOn, Broken] +
     SRB_time_left + time_acc (these are both single values) +
     [ComponentData, CoolantLoopData, RadiatorData]
    returns the derivative of y_1d, i.e.
    [VX, VY, AX, AY, Spin, 0, Fuel consumption, 0, 0, 0] + -constant + 0
    (zeroed-out fields are changed elsewhere)

    The ordering of fields is determined by the ordering in orbitx.proto.
    If the structure of the y_1d array changes, make sure to update this
    function and anywhere annotated with #Y_VECTOR_CHANGESITE!

    !!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!
    This function should return a DERIVATIVE. The numpy.solve_ivp function
    will do the rest of the work of the simulation, this function just
    describes how things _move_.
    At its most basic level, this function takes in the _position_ of
    everything (plus some random stuff), and returns the _velocity_ of
    everything (plus some random stuff).
    Essentially, numpy.solve_ivp does this calculation:
    new_positions_of_system = t_delta * _derive(
                                            current_t_of_system,
                                            current_y_of_system)

    Any arguments after `t` and `y_1d` are just extra constants and
    pass-through state, which should remain constant during normal simulation.
    They are passed in to speed up computation, since this function is the most
    performance-sensitive part of the orbitx codebase(!!!)
