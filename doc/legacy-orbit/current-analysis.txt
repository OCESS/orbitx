Just caring about the primary and secondary hab power buses, and assuming only the fuel cell and reactor are on

GOSUB 900 for our purposes is effectively ->
Rdenom# = -R1 - R6 - R1*R6/R2
I1# = (-V1 - V1*R6/R2 + V2*R6/R2)/Rdenom
P1# = R1 * I1 * I1
Vout# = V1 - R1*I1

Fuel cell for bus1:
V1# = Vfc
V2# = Vr / 83.33334
R1# = R_fc
R2# = R_reactor / 6944.445
R6# = R_t_bus1 / 6944.445
GOSUB 900
Ibus1fc = I1# = (-V1 - V1*R6/R2 + V2*R6/R2)/(-R1 - R6 - R1*R6/R2)


Fuel cell for bus2:
same variable setup, but
R6 = R_t_bus2
GOSUB 900
Ibus2fc = I1#
= (-V1 - V1*R6/R2 + V2*R6/R2)/(-R1 - R6 - R1*R6/R2)
= (V1 + R6*(V1/R2 - V2/R2))/(R1 + R6*(R1/R2))


Reactor for bus1:
V1 = Vr
V2 = Vfc * 83.33334
R1 = R_reactor
R2 = R_fc * 6944.445
R6 = R_t_bus1
GOSUB 900
Ibus1R = I1#
= (-V1 - V1*R6/R2 + V2*R6/R2)/(-R1 - R6 - R1*R6/R2)
= (V1 + R6*(V1/R2-V2/R2))/(R1 + R6*(1+R1/R2))

Reactor for bus2:
same variable setup, but
R6 = R_t_bus2 * 6944.445
GOSUB 900
Ibus2R = I1# = (-V1 - V1*R6/R2 + V2*R6/R2)/(-R1 - R6 - R1*R6/R2)


Putting it all together at the bottom:
bus_currents[0] = Ibus1R + Ibus1fc/83.33334
bus_currents[1] = Ibus2R*83.33334 + Ibus2fc
reactor_current = Ibus1R + Ibus2R
fuel_cell_current = Ibus1fc + Ibus2fc

Reactor_V_out = Vr - reactor_current * R_reactor
FC_V_out = Vfc - fuel_cell_current * R_fc

V_bus1 = (Reactor_V_out*Ibus1R + FC_V_out*Ibus1fc) / bus_currents[0]
V_bus2 = (Reactor_V_out*Ibus2R + FC_V_out*Ibus2fc) / bus_currents[1]

So it seems like the inputs to GOSUB 900 are:
V1 -> nominal voltage of power source under analysis
R1 -> internal resistance of power source under analysis
R6 -> total resistance of target bus
V2, V3, V4, V5 -> other nominal power source voltages
R2, R3, R4, R5 -> other internal power source resistances

--------------------------------------------

So overall, we go from
- knowing the resistance of all components on a bus
- to calculating the current/voltage/power coming from each power source
- to putting those together and finding the current/voltage/power on each bus

Importantly:
- it's probably easier to do nodal analysis per-power source, instead of per-bus
- maybe it's not worth it to come up with a
